scalaxb installation
====================

scalaxb is tested only under Scala 2.8.1. 

Installation using Scala Bazaar System (sbaz)
---------------------------------------------

The following downloads and installs the latest shared build of scalaxb
to the sbaz managed directory:

  $ sudo sbaz update
  $ sudo sbaz install scalaxb
  
Here's how to upgrade it if you've installed it before:

  $ sudo sbaz upgrade

Build from source
=================

Install git.

  http://git-scm.com/

Download and install simple-build-tool (sbt):

  http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Build
  
Grab scalaxb's source and build:
   
  $ git clone git://github.com/eed3si9n/scalaxb.git scalaxb
  $ cd scalaxb
  $ sbt update sbaz

This downloads the dependent libraries and produces
- target/scala_2.8.1/lib/scalaxb.jar 
- target/scala_2.8.1/scalaxb-x.x.x.sbp

You can use sbaz to install scalaxb package under the managed directory:

  $ sudo sbaz install -f target/scala_2.8.0/scalaxb-x.x.x.sbp

Alternatively, you can manually install the jar files.

Unix
----

Copy the jar in your ~/bin directory, then put the line

  java -Xmx1G -cp "scalaxb.jar" scalaxb.compiler.Main "$@"

in a file called scalaxb in your ~/bin directory and do

  $ chmod u+x ~/bin/scalaxb
  
This allows you to launch scalaxb in any directory by typing scalaxb at the
command prompt.

Windows
-------

Create a batch file scalaxb.bat:

  set SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0
  java -Xmx1G -jar "%SCRIPT_DIR%scalaxb.jar" %*

and put the jar in the same directory as the batch file. Put scalaxb.bat on your
path so that you can launch scalaxb in any directory by typing scalaxb at the
command prompt.

scalaxb installation
====================

scalaxb is tested only under Scala 2.8. 

Installation using Scala Bazaar System (sbaz)
---------------------------------------------

The following downloads and installs the latest shared build of scalaxb
to the sbaz managed directory:

  $ sudo sbaz install scalaxb

Build from source
=================

Install git.

  http://git-scm.com/

Download and install simple-build-tool (sbt):

  http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Build
  
Grab scalaxb's source and build:
   
  $ git clone git://github.com/eed3si9n/scalaxb.git scalaxb
  $ cd scalaxb
  $ sbt sbaz

This produces target/scala_2.8.0.Beta3/lib/scalaxb.jar and 
target/scala_2.8.0.Beta3/scalaxb-0.0.2.sbp.

You can use sbaz to install scalaxb package under the managed directory:

  $ sudo sbaz install -f target/scala_2.8.0.Beta3/scalaxb-0.0.2.sbp

Alternatively, you can manually install the jar files. The following
instructions are copied from simple-build-tool (sbt).

Unix
----

Put the jar in your ~/bin directory, put the line

  java -Xmx512M -jar `dirname $0`/scalaxb.jar "$@"

in a file called scalaxb in your ~/bin directory and do

  $ chmod u+x ~/bin/scalaxb.jar
  
This allows you to launch scalaxb in any directory by typing scalaxb at the
command prompt.

Windows
-------

Create a batch file scalaxb.bat:

  set SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0
  java -Xmx512M -jar "%SCRIPT_DIR%scalaxb.jar" %*

and put the jar in the same directory as the batch file. Put scalaxb.bat on your
path so that you can launch scalaxb in any directory by typing scalaxb at the
command prompt.

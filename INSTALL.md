scalaxb installation
====================

scalaxb is tested under Scala 2.9.0-1, but should also work for 2.8.1.
It also requires Java SE 6.

Use conscript
=============

Install conscript (cs).

- https://github.com/n8han/conscript/

Install scalaxb using it.

    $ cs eed3si9n/scalaxb

Install a SNAPSHOT version of scalaxb.

    $ cs eed3si9n/scalaxb/x.x.x-SNAPSHOT


Build from source
=================================

If you want to build from source, install git.

- http://git-scm.com/

Download and install simple-build-tool (sbt 0.10).

- https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Setup

Grab scalaxb's source and build:

    $ git clone git://github.com/eed3si9n/scalaxb.git scalaxb
    $ cd scalaxb

Open `project/build.scala` using your favorite editor, and change the version number to `local-SNAPSHOT`.
This way our Ivy cache won't be confused when the official builds are released.

    version := "local-SNAPSHOT",

Build, and publish it locally.

    $ sbt "project app" "so publish-local"

Finally, install it using conscript.

    $ cs --local eed3si9n/scalaxb/local-SNAPSHOT

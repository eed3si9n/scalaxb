## breaking changes
In an effort to solve namespace conflicts and to increase consistency among the plugins, [sbt plugins best practices](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Plugins-Best-Practices) was created. Here are the changes based on its recommendations:

### keys are under `ScalaxbKeys` object
Keys provided by sbt-scalaxb now resides in `ScalaxbKeys` object. Place the following at the top of your `build.sbt`:

    import ScalaxbKeys._

Scala identifiers for the keys remain the same (e.g. `packageName`), but key names accessible from the shell are now prefixed with `scalaxb-` (e.g. `scalaxb-package-name`).

### settings are scoped under `scalaxb` task
`scalaxb`-specific settings are now scoped under `scalaxb` task. The default settings `scalaxbSettings` is scoped additionally by `Compile` configuration (no more`Scalaxb` configuration!).

    seq(scalaxbSettings)

    packageName in scalaxb in Compile := "ipo"

    sourceGenerators in Compile <+= scalaxb in Compile

If you wish to use `scalaxb` task multiple times in a project, you can do so by creating custom configurations in `build.scala`.

    val Xsd = config("xsd") extend(Compile)
    val Wsdl = config("wsdl") extend(Compile)
    lazy val appSettings = buildSettings ++
      inConfig(Xsd)(baseScalaxbSettings ++ inTask(scalaxb)(customScalaxbSettings("xmlschema"))) ++
      inConfig(Wsdl)(baseScalaxbSettings ++ inTask(scalaxb)(customScalaxbSettings("wsdl11")))

    def customScalaxbSettings(base: String): Seq[Project.Setting[_]] = Seq(
      sources <<= xsdSource map { xsd => Seq(xsd / (base + ".xsd")) },
      packageName := base,
    )

## bug fixes and minor enhancements
- Fixes `anyType` support in wsdl. [#88](https://github.com/eed3si9n/scalaxb/issues/88) reported by [radirk](https://github.com/radirk)
- Fixes `SOAPAction` header in wsdl.
- Fixes `Fault` handling in wsdl.
- Uses Logback internally for logging.

## breaking changes

- scalaxb now generates `sys.error`, so the generated code will no longer be compilable under Scala 2.8. [#115][115] reported by [@idot][@idot] and others.

## dispatchVersion

A new key dispatchVersion was added to generate Dispatch 0.10.x compatible code [#210][210]:

    dispatchVersion in scalaxb in Compile := "0.10.0"

    libraryDependencies <+=(dispatchVersion in scalaxb in Compile) { dv =>
      "net.databinder.dispatch" %% "dispatch-core" % dv
    }

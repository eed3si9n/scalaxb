## non-blocking SOAP

scalaxb 1.2.0 generates non-blocking SOAP code by default. Instead of `Either[X, A]`, the SOAP call returns `Future[A]` and the fault, if any, is thrown as `Future`'s failure semantics.

    // default
    def getQuote(symbol: Option[String]): Future[stockquote.GetQuoteResponse]

    // async in (Compile, scalaxb) := false
    def getQuote(symbol: Option[String]): Either[scalaxb.Fault[Any], stockquote.GetQuoteResponse]
